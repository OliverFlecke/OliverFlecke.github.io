So I wanted to learn the names of some of these recognizable landmarks, so I took a photo of central London from the Canary Wharf area and build a webapp around it to display the name and some interesting information of each building, along with links to relevant sides about each.
The site can be found at &lt;a href="https://london.oliverflecke.me">london.oliverflecke.me&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

This was for a frontend, single-page application (SPA) where everything could be served as static HTML/CSS/JS files.
My solution was to allow users to sign in with their Github credentials using OAuth.
This is the best of both worlds: I won&amp;rsquo;t have to store any user data or think much about security, and users don&amp;rsquo;t have to trust me with their email or password.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Balut web app</title><link>https://oliverflecke.me/project/balut_game/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliverflecke.me/project/balut_game/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year when it became impossible to meet up and play games together, I wrote a web implementation of the game &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balut_(game)">Balut&lt;/a>.
It is not the most known game in the world, but one that I have always enjoyed as a child.
The game can be found at &lt;a href="https://balut.app">balut.app&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rules-of-balut">Rules of Balut&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The goal of the game is similar to the game of Yahtzee.
The player starts each round with fives dices, and has up to three throws to collect a set of dices that they enter onto the board.
At each roll, the player can choose to save any number of dices and re-roll the remaining.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sudoku solver in Prolog</title><link>https://oliverflecke.me/project/prolog_sudoku_solver/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliverflecke.me/project/prolog_sudoku_solver/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="primer">Primer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A few days ago, I was doing a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sudoku&lt;/a>, a puzzle game similar to cross word puzzles, but where the goal is to fill out every cell with a number.
Each number has to fulfill the following rules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Each &lt;em>row&lt;/em> of numbers must be distinct&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each &lt;em>column&lt;/em> of numbers must be distinct&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each &lt;em>3x3 square&lt;/em> of numbers must be distinct&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Quite simple, but it can still provide some interesting and challenging problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Home</title><link>https://oliverflecke.me/blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliverflecke.me/blog/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
