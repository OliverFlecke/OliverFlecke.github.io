So I wanted to learn the names of some of these recognizable landmarks, so I took a photo of central London from the Canary Wharf area and build a webapp around it to display the name and some interesting information of each building, along with links to relevant sides about each. The site can be found at london.oliverflecke.me.</description></item><item><title>Convertible Currency</title><link>https://oliverflecke.me/currency/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliverflecke.me/currency/</guid><description>A minimalistic currency conversion app, available on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Mac!

This was for a frontend, single-page application (SPA) where everything could be served as static HTML/CSS/JS files. My solution was to allow users to sign in with their Github credentials using OAuth.

It is not the most known game in the world, but one that I have always enjoyed as a child. The game can be found at balut.app.
Rules of Balut The goal of the game is similar to the game of Yahtzee. The player starts each round with fives dices, and has up to three throws to collect a set of dices that they enter onto the board.</description></item><item><title>Sudoku solver in Prolog</title><link>https://oliverflecke.me/project/prolog_sudoku_solver/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliverflecke.me/project/prolog_sudoku_solver/</guid><description>Primer A few days ago, I was doing a Sudoku, a puzzle game similar to cross word puzzles, but where the goal is to fill out every cell with a number. Each number has to fulfill the following rules:
Each row of numbers must be distinct Each column of numbers must be distinct Each 3x3 square of numbers must be distinct Quite simple, but it can still provide some interesting and challenging problems.</description></item><item><title>Home</title><link>https://oliverflecke.me/blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliverflecke.me/blog/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
