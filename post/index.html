This was for a frontend, single-page application (SPA) where everything could be served as static HTML/CSS/JS files. My solution was to allow users to sign in with their Github credentials using OAuth. This is the best of both worlds: I won&rsquo;t have to store any user data or think much about security, and users don&rsquo;t have to trust me with their email or password.</p></li><li class="my-4 p-4 border rounded bg-coolGray-200 dark:bg-coolGray-800"><a href=https://oliverflecke.me/post/balut_game/>2021-03-08 | Balut web app</a><p class="text-coolGray-900 dark:text-coolGray-300">Last year when it became impossible to meet up and play games together, I wrote a web implementation of the game Balut. It is not the most known game in the world, but one that I have always enjoyed as a child. The game can be found at balut.app.
Rules of Balut The goal of the game is similar to the game of Yahtzee. The player starts each round with fives dices, and has up to three throws to collect a set of dices that they enter onto the board.</p></li><li class="my-4 p-4 border rounded bg-coolGray-200 dark:bg-coolGray-800"><a href=https://oliverflecke.me/post/prolog_sudoku_solver/>2020-10-31 | Sudoku solver in Prolog</a><p class="text-coolGray-900 dark:text-coolGray-300">Primer A few days ago, I was doing a Sudoku, a puzzle game similar to cross word puzzles, but where the goal is to fill out every cell with a number. Each number has to fulfill the following rules:
Each row of numbers must be distinct Each column of numbers must be distinct Each 3x3 square of numbers must be distinct Quite simple, but it can still provide some interesting and challenging problems.</p></li></ol></section></div></main><footer class="w-full p-4 bg-purple-800"><span class="text-sm text-coolGray-200">Website created with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and styled with
