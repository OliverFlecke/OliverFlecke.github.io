I'm Oliver Fleckenstein, a **software engineer** developing web, mobile, and embedded applications.
Passionate about technology and building software to solve problems.
Curious as a person and I always eager for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow from.
I have always enjoyed working both independently and in teams with talented people from all over the world.

### Software skills

I have strong fundamentals in and experience working with both object-oriented and functional languages.
I enjoy working with both backend and frontend development, and have build several REST APIs in ASP .NET and NodeJS, using OAuth 2 for authentication and OpenApi.
For mobile development, I have created cross-platform apps in Xamarin (and now learning MAUI), along with iOS apps in Swift.

### Other skills

Strong knowledge of data structures and algorithms, and always looking for ways to write better and cleaner code, following practices such as SOLID and TDD.
I believe in strong agile development frameworks, with rapid iterations and feedback loops.
To assist with this during development, I always aim to have efficient Continuos-Integration and Continues-Deployment flows to ease testing and validation of code, along with often releases.
