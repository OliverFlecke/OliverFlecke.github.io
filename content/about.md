I'm Oliver Fleckenstein.
I'm a software developer for the web and mobile, and I always enjoy new challenges to learn and grow by.

## Software skills

### Programming languages and frameworks

- C# (.NET Core / ASP NET / Xamarin)
- Python
- F#

- Swift

I have dappled around with several other languages, and always find it interesting to see how different tools try to solve the same problems.

### Web technologies

- TypeScript/JavaScript
- React
- HTML/CSS
- SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Docker
